Rock Paper Scissors in Python!

#Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll onl get a virtual sting if you lose!

Clone the project, navigate to the correct directory - cd directory name - and run the game.py file in a Python 3 Terminal window for macOS / linux.

The rules are the same as the classic game:

1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cuts Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors

Choose your weapon wisely!

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.

Built with Python 3.
